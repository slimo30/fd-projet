Evaluating Preprocessing Quality for Cannabis Classification:
============================================================

Model: Decision Tree
Baseline            : F1-Score = 0.3327, Accuracy = 0.3369
Binary              : F1-Score = 0.8089, Accuracy = 0.8064
Binary+Scaling      : F1-Score = 0.8089, Accuracy = 0.8064

Model: K-Nearest Neighbors
Baseline            : F1-Score = 0.3654, Accuracy = 0.3926
Binary              : F1-Score = 0.8469, Accuracy = 0.8435
Binary+Scaling      : F1-Score = 0.8395, Accuracy = 0.8355

Conclusion: Binary target simplification significantly improves F1-scores.
